We have developed a temperature-humidity array for use in applications in forest and fire ecology. The following instructions provide step-by-step instructions for assembling the arrays and dataloggers. We also include software development and installation, and provide files to fabricate 3d-printed radiation shields, enclosures, and files necessary for manufacturing printed circuit boards for multiplexing.

# Overview

The following document provides detailed instructions on fabrication of SHT31-D sensor arrays. Each section begins with materials required for assembly. Please read all instructions before begining to ensure all necessary materials are available. 

* Fabricate [temperature and humidity sensor arrays](#SHT31-D-Sensor-arrays) (8x sensors)
* Fabricate 3d printed radiation shields
* Prepare Particle Boron-based dataloggers
  * Testing Particle Boron
  * Programing Particle Boron
  * Setting up cellular cloud data upload
* Fabricate datalogger assembly
* Sensor array deployment 

Materials required for each section are listed in the corresponding section

# SHT31-D Sensor arrays



# 3D printing

We currently use two types of 3d printed radiation sheilds: a minimalist sheild, and a larger enclosed, multi-tiered sheild for longer-term abiotic monitoring. All sheilds are 3-printed in PETG use a PRUSA MK3S+ printer.

Data loggers require 

Include files and print settings for

Large radiation sheild
Minimal radiation sheild
