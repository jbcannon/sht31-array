We have developed a temperature-humidity array for use in applications in forest and fire ecology. The following instructions provide step-by-step instructions for assembling the arrays, and options for data-loggers, and software are included.

# 3D printing

We currently use two types of 3d printed radiation sheilds: a minimalist sheild, and a larger enclosed, multi-tiered sheild for longer-term abiotic monitoring. All sheilds are 3-printed in PETG use a PRUSA MK3S+ printer.

Data loggers require
